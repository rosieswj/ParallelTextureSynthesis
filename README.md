## Summary

Texture synthesis is an image-generation technique commonly used to produce high-quality textures when rendering synthetic graphics. In this project we used multithreading with OpenMP to parallelize an algorithm called non-parametric sampling for texture synthesis.

## Background

Define texture as some visual pattern of an infinite 2D plane. Texture synthesis is the process of taking a finite fixed shape sample from a texture to generate other samples of a different dimension from the given texture. Potential graphic applications of texture synthesis include image de-noising, occlusion fill-in, image compression, etc. Below are some examples of inputs and respective sample outputs of texture synthesis. The first row represents the input (a fixed n by n sample), the bottom rows are the output generated by the program.
